<h1>Rubik's Cube Solver</h1>					

<p><b>Problem Description:</b> Implement a program to solve Rubik's Cube. The program should take as input an unsolved Rubik's Cube and output the moves to solve the cube.</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b> The program should be able to solve any valid Rubik's Cube and handle varying levels of difficulty.</p>					
<p><b>Algorithm:</b> Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search and A* Algorithm</p>
<p><b>Input:</b> An unsolved Rubik's Cube.</p>		
<p><b>Output:</b> The moves to solve the cube.</p>
